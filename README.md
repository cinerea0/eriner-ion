# eriner-ion
This is a port of the [eriner zsh theme](https://github.com/zimfw/eriner) to the Ion shell.
It depends on some basic unix utilities, and it is unknown if it works on non-Linux systems.
Currently, it has a decent amount of the functionality of the original theme; more functionality will be added as the capabilities of the Ion shell increase.
Simply download the script, source it in your initrc for Ion, and set the contents of your `PROMPT` function to `prompt_eriner_main`.

If you'd like to customize it, I highly recommend the [Ion syntax highlighting plugin for vim](https://github.com/vmchale/ion-vim) developed by vmchale.
